`pgsmetrics` makes it easy to compute metrics for polygenic scores and to bootstrap uncertainty intervals.

These metrics are:

1. Overall fit / model comparison
    - Nagelkerke's $R^2$ (binary)
    - Liability scale $R^2$ (binary)
    - Brier score (binary)
    - $R^2$ (continuous)
    - MSE (continuous)
    - MAE (continuous)
    - AIC
2. Discrimination:
    - ROC AUC (binary)
3. Calibration:
    - `plot_calibration`
4. Clinical utility
    - Net benefit, decision curve plot (`plot_dcurve`)

(It is also possible to add custom metrics â†’ see `Metric` `R6` class.)

It is possible to use an alternative bootstrap method, the [Bag of Little Bootstraps](https://arxiv.org/abs/1112.5016) (BLB, `boot_type = "blb"`), which is useful when the number of samples and PGS is large (f.x., 500K samples and 50 PGS).
